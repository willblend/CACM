= ActionMailerMock =

Adds delivery mocking to ActionMailer. ActionMailerMock allows you to set ActionMailer::Base.perform_deliveries = :mock (in addition to the default
true/false values.) When ActionMailer is mocked, all deliveries will be sent
to a single, configurable address so you can test mailings without spamming
live users.

The two variables you will need to configure are 
ActionMailer::Base.mock_address and ActionMailer::Base.exception_address:

ActionMailer::Base.mock_address = 'dev-account@digitalpulp.com
ActionMailer::Base.exception_address = 'exception-list@digitalpulp.com'

mock_address is the email that all mail will be redirected to.
exception_address is the address that your exceptions come from.
ActionMailerMock does _not_ redirect exceptions, so that they may reach your
alerts list.
