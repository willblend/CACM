= SphinxSearch

Adds ThinkingSphinx [http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/] support to Radiant.

== Usage

You'll need the ThinkingSphinx plugin installed. You'll probably want to use
commit 18b1f310911ab49bb510dc5331edad9c1073ea73 or higher -- Sphinx may not
index the complete content of every page otherwise. By default, the first 8kB
of any page's concatenated page parts will be indexed. You can change this in 
page_extensions.rb if that's not enough space, or if you wish to reduce it in 
order to keep your indexes lean.

The Page index is defined for you. Pages will be indexed on title and content,
with a field boost applied to title. Attributes are added to the index for 
status_id and updated_at. An additional column is added to the Pages table 
containing a 'searchable' boolean; toggle this on/off from within the page 
edit view to control which pages appear in your search results. Searching pages
works as described in the TS documentation.

This is the Digital Pulp version of SphinxSearch, and is dependent on the 
MultiSite and Workflow extensions. The site_id column isn't very DRY, but 
with Radiant's current schema it's impossible to query a page's root.site.id 
with simple (read: TS-friendly) SQL.
