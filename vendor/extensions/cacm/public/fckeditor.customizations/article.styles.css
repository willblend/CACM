/*

the BODY's margin-right attempts to emulate the available content width in the 
front-end version of the page. for a 960px width editing area, we have 924px 
to work with.

  924px = 960px - FCK IFRAME padding (4px) - BODY padding (8px x 2) - scrollbar (16px)

otherwise, subtract 36px from your editing area width.

NOTES:
 * setting the width of the BODY doesn't work in IE, or else we could do that.
 * we assume the scrollbar is always visible, but that is not always the case.
   therefore, the width is slightly off. a fix for this is TBD.
 * this doesn't work in full-screen mode -- we'd have to detect it and change 
   the CSS to accommodate it.

editing area width : 640px (604px available)
content width      : 555px
