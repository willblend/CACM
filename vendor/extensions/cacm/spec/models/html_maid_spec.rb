      "<p>Some years ago, the database research community jumped into XML. Finally, something new to work on! For about 5 years now, I have seen predictions that the XML databases would take the world over. Every organization would soon have its XML database. People would run web sites out of XML databases. Countless start-ups emerged ready to become the next Oracle.</p>\r\n<p>What happened in practise is a bit underwhelming. Oracle, Microsoft, MySQL and others all included some XML support in their relational databases, but native XML databases failed to grasp any market share.</p>\r\n<p>Where are we?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Regarding programming languages, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/\">XQuery</a> finally became a W3C recommendation in January 2007. More or less, XQuery together with XPath  specify the equivalent of a select instruction in SQL.</li>\r\n    <li>What if you want to update your XML database?<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://xmldb-org.sourceforge.net/xupdate/\">XUpdate</a> has been around for some time, but it is not widely supported. The W3C is working on something called <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-update-10/\">XQuery Update Facility</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Interfacing XQuery with your favorite programming language is still awkward. We have an <a href=\"http://xmldb-org.sourceforge.net/xapi/\">API for XML databases</a> (XML:DB), but I am not sure how well it is supported by the various vendors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Want to take an XML database out for a spin? Some XML databases worthy of mention:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://exist-db.org/\">eXist</a> is open source and free.</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://modis.ispras.ru/sedna/\">Sedna</a> is another free XML database.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>My take</strong>: Once again, the relational data model shows great resilience in the marketplace. It is entirely possible that XML databases may go the way of the objected-oriented databases: useful for some niche problems, but nothing more. We could blame the lack of standards for the failure of XML databases, but SQL was never standardized and still took off.</p>\r\n<p>I like XML. I like CSS. I like XSLT/XPath. But I have always be less certain about XQuery.</p>\r\n<p>XML databases look too much like a solution in search of a problem.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: The W3C publishes the result of their <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/test-suite/XQTSReportSimple.html\">XQuery conformance testing</a>.

I've been using a model something like this for quite a while too. It's interesting to visit companies and see their reach and spread on this model, and to spot the distinctive signs of change that result.</p><p>It is resonant with a  much older piece of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stages_of_faith_development\">research on the psychology of human belief systems</a> (which works beyond just the religious since capitalism is also a belief system) by James Fowler in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stages-Faith-Psychology-Development-Meaning/dp/0060628669/?tag=2009-408-20\">Stages of Faith</a> from 1981. The two aren't identical but they suggest there's an underlying maturity model at work.</p><p>Aslett asks where Microsoft is placed in the model. Cal Evans responds </p><blockquote class=\"cite\">Having just returned from 3 days in Redmond discussing PHP on Windows with Microsoft, I agree that Microsoft cannot be pinned to a single stage on this chart. However, realistically, even their forward thinking divisions are no farther along than contribute. I would spread them between denial and contribute with denial being the majority and contribute being the long tail.</blockquote>I'd agree that every organisation shows this characteristic. Even at Sun, where the software development groups are deeply engaged at stage 5, I still find myself sometimes with staff who are at earlier stages. This is as one would expect from Fowler's work, since every individual will reflect a different stage of their evolution.<p>They will likely operate at different levels of maturity in different areas of their life as well. This is not a bad thing, and one of the risks of using a \"maturity model\" is the temptation to treat the later stages as \"better\". When we do this, instead of valuing and supporting people in the lower-numbered stages, we treat them as \"in need of growth\".</p><h3>Maturity Spread and Reach</h3><p>It's easy to forget that corporations (and indeed large non-profits) are not people, but are rather a vehicle for the collective expression of the vision of many individuals. Things happen not because a faceless corporation somehow chooses to act, but because of the persuasive decisions of actual people, acting within their belief systems. Every good - and bad - decision ultimately goes back to an individual somewhere.</p><p>In any collective group, there will be a maturity <i>reach</i> and <i>spread</i>. The \"reach\" is the furthest stage the most pioneering individual of any influence has been able to take a team. The \"\"spread\" will be the range of stages the collective grouping willing to tolerate existing within itself. Thus in the example Aslett seeks of Microsoft, the reach is to stage 3 on the data in the comments (I would actually suggest recent staff changes may even push that to stage 4) and the spread is back to stage 1 with the weighted centre around stage 1. In Sun, the reach is stage 5 and the spread goes back to stage 1 and is weighted around the stage 3-4 boundary. This is also a fractal effect, exhibited within the groups that comprise each organisation.</p><p>That's why I <i>expect</i> Sun, Microsoft, IBM and other corporations to be inconsistent in their approach to open source. I also expect to find that in large groups like Apache and Eclipse there will be a good deal of inconsistency of view. I get very suspicious of attempts to make open source engagement appear uniform across such a wide spread of activities. Both the model Aslett reports on and the work Fowler did in 1981 suggest to me that real engagement will be diverse. And that's actually a good thing.</p></p>",

Although I have not read the full report yet, I agree with the basic claim.  In my own experience, where I was heavily involved in analysis in a large enterprise, there were at least a half dozen tools that were commonly used.  Plus just about every other tool was being used somewhere for something.  <br /><br />It is true that this creates considerable chaos.  Much of hidden deep in budgets and collaboration complexity.  Duplication of training, interfaces, licenses and the understanding of the basic assumptions used by various tools is a costly mess for the enterprise.<br /><br />So why is this the case?  In part because there are no complete definitions for the meaning of BI.  As a result many enterprise packages like SAP and Oracle come with their own BI capabilities.  What were once purely statistical packages like SPSS and SAS that now have BI constructs.  Even ubiquitous packages like Excel have become so feature rich that they too can be transformed into something that looks much like BI.  <br /><br />It is easy to convince management that any of the packages above have just that feature that will provide the key transformational analysis that will solve an important problem.   IT may disagree, especially if the license fee is high, and may argue that the complexity added to the enterprise has its own cost, but in general they will lose the argument because they just do not understand the analytical side of the argument.  <br /><br />Finally BI tools proliferate because their best advocates are new-hires coming out of school have been trained in the use of new tools.  It is something fresh, new and unique, like them.  Which is why vendors provide free licenses to Universities.  So the training of new people in the internal tool is a barrier.  The overall costs are not thought through.  Management usually does not understand the features and mathematics of tools already in use.  Once a shiny new tool is brought in and is presented to the right management it is then very hard to dislodge.<br /><br />I have seen this complexifying effect operate for many years, in fact for my entire career in the enterprise.  At least now we rarely write our own tools, but the sheer number of options is numbing today.<br /><br />So what to do about it?  Have a core team that really understands the infrastructure, IT and mathematical capabilities of the tools in use. They also need to know how the problems have been solved in the past.  The team needs to work with all the divisions:  Engineering, R&D, HR and marketing etc ....   It also needs to have some clout and reasonable veto power.   They also need to make the overall solution more accessible and easier in most cases.  Benchmark with similar firms. <br /><br />Sure there may be a need for specialized vertical capabilities.  But with only some work these can be kept at a minimum.  Choosing a limited set of options also allows the construction of libraries of solutions that can be reapplied.  Have analytical experts available that can evaluate the problem solutions.  Connect all your BI users together with Web tools so they can collaborate, that is easy today.</p>",

I was at the conference but a scheduling conflict prevented me attending IDABC's session, which I regret.</p>\n<br /><h4>Good News</h4>\n<br /><p>I very much welcome the guidelines; as I have been saying for well over a year now, the first step to encouraging the use of Free/open source software in the public sphere is to facilitate <a href=\"http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/the_adoption_led_market\">the adoption-led model</a> in addition to the procurement-driven model, at the very least to the extent of encouraging two-phase procurement. As Rishab <a href=\"http://www.osor.eu/news/hidden-cost-of-proprietary-standards-may-lead-to-illegal-tenders\">pointed out</a> (although not with the same words), there are also the issues of <a href=\"http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/freedom_to_leave\">substitutability and the freedom to leave</a>, which I believe it's fundamental for a public administration to consider. </p><p>Substitutability guarantees citizens access to government without being forced to trade with a single vendor in order to do so, and the freedom to leave ensures public administrations always have the negotiating power to get the best deal for taxpayers. The guidelines begin to address those issues as well - great news.</p>\n<br /><h4>Concerns</h4>\n<br /><p>The journalist went on to ask me about all the <a href=\"http://www.osor.eu/news/many-software-tenders-in-eu-illegal\">documented procurement violations</a>. It seems that: </p><blockquote class=\"cite\">Of a sample of 3615 software tenders that were published between January and August this year, 36 percent request Microsoft software, 20 percent ask for Oracle, 12 percent mention IBM applications, 11 percent request SAP and 10 percent are asking for applications made by Adobe.</blockquote><p>That's bad enough, and likely illegal in most cases, but then it also turns out:</p><blockquote class=\"cite\">According to Gosh, software tenders often have either implicit or explicit bias for software brands or even specific applications. Of a thousand government IT organisations, 33 percent said compatibility with previously acquired software is the most important criterion when selecting new applications. Ghosh: \"This implicit vendor-lock in means that a tender, meant to last for only five years, leads to a contractual relation lasting ten, fifteen years or more.\"</blockquote><p>Most concerning of all, however, was that despite this all being completely transparent and public, the Commission is doing nothing about it. They regard the problem as being one that the competitors of the favoured companies should address through the courts. That would be fine if the market was largely functional and there were only rare cases of abuse.</p><p>But it's not. The improper procurement activity is endemic, and until that's addressed any competitor attempting to act through the courts is likely to find themselves discriminated against even further. It's never good to sue your customers (as the music industry is finding), and in a market where the customers can specify you out of the running with impunity, it's suicidal. Moreover, it can take years for the courts to make a ruling, which means even more lost opportunity for competing companies - assuming they can survive the wait. Until the European Commission takes adequate corrective actions to address this disease, there is no step in the current software market condition that any competitor is likely to take to address it. </p>\n<br /><h4>Recourse?</h4><p>Given the scale of the disadvantage already present, why would any player want to make their position worse?

Many of my colleagues, retired or back at the firm are also members.  Have made a number of interesting and profitable connections based on my membership. The psych of it has interested me from the very beginning.  Just read a good piece on how you should use it to <a href=\"http://www.sportsnetworker.com/2008/12/18/13-ways-to-generate-massive-success-on-linkedin/\">generate massive success</a>. Linkedin recommends that you only accept invites from those you know.  The article basically suggests that the more in your network the merrier.  <br /><br />I have never invited people I did not know at all, but I have invited people I knew through others, or wanted to connect with better.  I have been ignored a few times, but only gotten the reply 'I do not know you' once ... strangely I did know the person.  What is the psych of casual rejection?  <br /><br />So what is the best size of a professional network?   There is not much effort in sending an invitation.  I don't think I would invite someone who was in a completely different industry, though my expertise, business improvement, could play everywhere.  <br /><br />One commenter in the article says they are suspicious of people how have hundreds of people in their network.  I have a couple of hundred.  I don't think that is too many, I have valuably connected with many hundreds in my company, vendors, suppliers, academia and organizations over the years.  A few hundred is still pretty selective.<br /><br />Speaking from the view of someone with many years of experience and now consulting, I come down on the side of the more, reasonably considered, connections you have, the more value you create.  Especially if you are seeking consulting and information connections.  Even more so in the case of group memberships, I have joined a number of them and ended up with people contacting me because I joined and that has led to unusual and very useful connections.</p>",

The Web's most extensive math resource ... \" </i>.  Consider for example <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanTheorem.html\">their coverage</a> of the Pythagorean Theorem, and the famous misstatement of it by the scarecrow in the <em><strong>1939 Wizard of Oz movie</strong></em>:  <i>\"The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.\" </i>  (wrong)<br /><br />It is notable that this is also covered by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem\">Wikipedia article on the PT</a>, with some additional examples of the PT as a cultural meme. <br /><br />In general I have found the WP accurate for general overviews of math topics, though the way each topic is covered varies considerably.  In some cases it assumes much, in some cases not.  One of the early uses I found for the Web was using resources that SAS provided in the form of short, easy to digest, executive friendly descriptions of statistical topics.  I used the availability of these resources as an argument for bringing Web access in house in the mid 90s. <br /><br />Exploration inspired by  <strong>Matthew Hurst</strong> in <a href=\"http://datamining.typepad.com/data_mining/2009/01/pythagoras-of-oz.html\">Data Mining</a>.</p>",

A means of visualizing searches and determining the connections between search results.  Many new features in <a href=\"http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html\">this new version</a>.  When you search on a URL or some text you will get a connected graph that you can then drag around, select items to expand or edit and explore connections. <br /><br /> I remember using an earlier version to do some competitive intelligence.  Although most of the connections were obvious I did find some links that were surprising.  My experience with these kinds of visualizations is that they don't provide a way that you may want the structure of the data arranged, but the new look can lead to things you may have not known.  Well worth a look.   <br /><br />Above is a visualization of the term 'neuromarketing'.  In the application each of the nodes can then be clicked on to expand the space.  Areas of no interest can be pruned away.</p>",

(M1 no longer exists) It was designed so that any clever employee could build their own expert systems based on their own or an experts knowledge.  A user could construct a decision tree, or use a list of cases to generate a tree. Dozens of applications were built with the system, though it never became as widely used as we hoped.  Ultimately the AI hype receded and our AI team disbanded.<br /><br />These kinds of expertise problems still exist and this package is worth looking at to solve decision tree style problems.  I know because as an internal consultant they frequently came up. I am investigating some possible applications now.     I would appreciate any comments on applying LPA.</p>",

I admit to have taken a free book a handful of times.<br /><br /> It is a very cheap way for a company to get mention, especially effective with bloggers that have big readership.  Of course it can cloud the objectivity, or at least the reason why a blogger has chosen a given topic.  Even if they do not need the money, bloggers are always looking for things do write about.

Have followed its progress since then and even visited them in Austin several times to see what value they might provide our enterprise.  <br /><br />Originally their goal was to create a complete knowledge database that could act as an encyclopedia (thus 'cyc') that could be used by any application as a domain knowledge repository.  For example, you might include pieces of knowledge about manufacturing specifications in a knowledge base, then later use it to understand how new products might be created.  Has some similarities to the ultimate goals of the Semantic Web.  Some examples of the kinds of work they do <a href=\"http://blog.cyc.com/\">in the CYC blog</a>.  Such as advanced query systems in specific domains that can reason in complex ways.  <br /><br />Now they have a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/cyc_ai\">Twitter post you can follow</a> where some system is posting a 'nugget' of generated knowledge about every 15 minutes.

Marriott tried to do something that included lots of easy interconnectivity in a hotel room, so you could create your own heaven ... or depending on view perhaps it was the other place?  I was part of an innovation group that worked with Hilton to do something similar, though all the resources we had were some flip charts.  <br /><br />I now have been involved with and seen a number of examples of 'of the future' concepts, including homes, stores, hotels and decision centers.   I have never seen anything close to any one implemented completely.  Yet they are great places to test how a new idea can be presented to a consumer and react to the values it claims to provide.  Another example recently brought to my attention is the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7348940.stm\">Brussels House of the Future</a>.  <br /><br />The Fraunhofer hotel example looks well thought out, though again much about information technology rather than architecture or direct comfort.

Several people had pointed me to it. It is an overview of the advance of numerical methods since WWII.  How improvements in the availability of data, power of computers and new methods have led to remarkable results. Key too are the number of sensors that have revealed data from people. The Web is the prime example.  These results have also led to some scary and wrong results.  For example, one person interviewed had been a major modeler for Enron and could not predict it's fall.  Today he is head of a modeling group for IBM.  <br /><br /> I was educated in this field  and a practitioner during the latter half of this progression, so the stories told of its history were well known.  Baker does not provide much detail and does not know the math, data and computing issues behind the problems. Sometimes the difficulties involved are understated.  So there is little hard substance.  Yet as the people interviewed discussed their current work I was reminded of similar efforts in my own firm.  So I enjoyed the book and I think any practitioner in this area will as well.  <br /><br />I was once told that for every equation you include in a book you will lose 20% of your audience.  This book will lose none of its audience that way.  Still it is a good view of the progress and the dangers of having models that predict things.  And especially when we attempt to predict what people can or will do.  <br /><br />He ends the book being cautious and describing the complexity of the world and how there are aspects of that complexity we have not figured out how to model.  That is an appropriate place to leave a book like this.  We have made much progress, it has value, but it does not mean we are or ever can be done.  There is danger in thinking we can do more than we are ready to. <br /><br />See also <a href=\"http://thenumerati.net/\">the book's blog</a>.</p>",

This was the third time I had been in on Lindstrom presentations. He pointed out that much of his work is still research, but very useful in better understanding the consumer, even in its early development.  Today you can go to <a href=\"http://www.martinlindstrom.com/\">his site</a> and download his slides using the password 'fabulous'.  I also <a href=\"http://eponymouspickle.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-we-smoke.html\">reviewed and recommend his book</a>, which has lots more.<br /><br />Lindstrom gave a good overview of some parts of his book, outlining how in particular rituals in retail can be both positive and negative to the retailer and manufacturer.  He covered briefly his controversial findings about branding and religion. He also emphasized the uniqueness of the 2000 scan data base that has provided many opportunities for pattern mining.  <br /><br />Next <strong>Gary Singer</strong>, CEO of the newly established <a href=\"http://www.buyologyinc.com\">Buyology Inc</a> spoke about how his company will be implementing some of Lindstrom's work.  In particular they have developed what they call <strong>'Neurotypes'</strong>, which allow a customer to readily understand how their customers brands link to the patterns derived from Lindstrom's brain scan database.  These classifications can then be used to market to consumers and even optimize the kinds of media to be used.  He also made it clear that Buyology Inc was not tied to any specific biometric technology such as fMRI and was linking to a number of key analysis vendors.  <br /><br /><br /><strong>Julie Anixter</strong> CMO of <strong>Brand Image</strong> gave a talk on a collaborative investigative project with Buyology Inc.  Specifically to evaluate packaging using some of Buyology Inc's non-conscious classification methods.  They are looking for participants at relatively low cost.  You can be part of a powerful new methodology.  Contact Julie for more information at:  janixter@brand-image.com<br /><br />Overall a good talk that led from Lindstrom's inspiration via his experiments and book to the establishment of a company to deliver results and then the launch of a specific project to test the idea.</p>",

Doing this broadly is also called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing\">astroturfing</a>, building buzz unsupported by reality.  <br /><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5UV83Rj8YXo/SXXqtYMHgdI/AAAAAAAAA_g/r9LqYefG8Kc/s1600-h/mechnicalturk.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5UV83Rj8YXo/SXXqtYMHgdI/AAAAAAAAA_g/r9LqYefG8Kc/s320/mechnicalturk.jpg\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5293395002352173522\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></a> What was interesting here is that this was done through the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk\">Amazon's Mechanical Turk System</a>,  a crowdsourcing intelligent human task marketing system that I looked at closely last year.  They were offering 65 US cents per post for each review.  Machines are cheaper than humans, but only if they can perform a task. General artificial intelligence is not here yet, despite some claims, not even close.  So there are many tasks a human can do that a machine cannot.  Like interpreting and tagging a complex image. Certainly writing and posting a credible product review of any kind is an 'intelligent task'.  <br /><br />Not much different from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_per_post\">PayPerPost company</a>, which brokers connections between writers and entities that need publicity.

Not sure of the status of that 'policing' today, though it raises another meta level of concern:  How objective is Google? <br /><br />A general human dilemma, back to issues of authority and credibility of the agent involved.

The robot will then interact with the driver to get the driver in a better mood, or suggest that the driver pull over and rest.  Thrun says the United States should be pushing these technologies more aggressively than anyone else.  &quot;For me, the American spirit is one of innovation, and I don't see this that right now coming out of Detroit,&quot; he says.  &quot;This nation should take this moment to think about why we are not the leader in automotive technology.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Thrun says that refocusing on technology will not save the industry from the current crisis, but that car company engineers must immediately focus on how technology can be put to better use, particularly robotics.  &quot;We can make cars drive themselves,&quot; he says.  &quot;Human pilots are only allowed to land the planes themselves during good weather.  Autopilot must be used in bad weather.  With robotics, we could make cars much, much safer.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>From <em>Computerworld</em><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9120740\">View Full Article</a></p>",
      "<p>The surpassing of petaflop speeds by a new breed of supercomputers could facilitate a profound scientific transformation by bringing simulation to the cutting edge of science, according to leading researchers.  &quot;The new capability allows you to do fundamentally new physics and tackle new problems,&quot; says Thomas Zacharia of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  &quot;And it will accelerate the transition from basic research to applied technology.&quot;  The new machines will enable scientists to run models of complex phenomena, such as weather systems, with far greater accuracy.  The public's interest in climate change and its potential effects is putting pressure on researchers to create precise predictive simulations, and petaflop computers can deliver the much higher resolution needed for such models.  IBM and Cray have developed machines that have broken the petaflop barrier, and Oak Ridge's Cray XT5 Jaguar has 362 TB of memory, which is 300 percent more memory capacity than any other computer, says Zacharia.  So that researchers' switch to Jaguar was as seamless as possible, designers let them use existing applications rather than programming new ones.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>Wired</em><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/11/supercomputers.html\">View Full Article</a></p>",
      "<p>In 1991, Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student Ellen Spertus published the paper, &quot;Why Are There So Few Female Computer Scientists?&quot;  Nearly 20 years later there are even fewer women entering the field, and the reasons why are still largely a matter of dispute.  One puzzling aspect is that the explanations for the under-representation of women established in 1991 applied to all technical fields, but women have since achieved parity with men in almost every other technical area.  In all science and engineering fields, the percentage of bachelor's degrees awarded to women has increased to 51 percent in 2004-2005, up from 39 percent in 1984-1985, according to the National Science Foundation.  However, in computer science the percentage of women has been declining.  In 2001-2002, only 28 percent of all undergraduate degrees in computer science were awarded to women, and by 2004-2005 that number dropped to 22 percent.  The Computing Research Association says that women accounted for only 12 percent of undergraduate degrees in computer science and engineering in the United States and Canada in 2006-2007 at Ph.D.-granting institutions, a drop from 19 percent in 2001-2002.  Many computer science departments report that women now account for less than 10 percent of new undergraduates.  University of Wisconsin-Whitewater professor Jonathan Kane believes that young women felt more comfortable pursing a computer science major before the male-dominated subculture of action gaming developed.  Northwestern University Center for Technology and Social Behavior's Justine Cassell says the widespread stereotype of computer science professionals as &quot;nerds&quot; or &quot;geeks&quot; accounts for the lack of interest in the field.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>The New York Times</em><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16digi.html?_r=1\">View Full Article</a>",
      "<p>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid School of Computing researchers have developed a prototype metropolitan quantum-key distribution network that will be ready for deployment by Telefonica on any Spanish urban telecommunications network by 2010.  The prototype is being developed as part of the Security and Confidence in the Information Society research and development project, which includes a consortium of 12 companies and 15 public research institutions.  The project's goal is to create a new generation of integral security solutions capable of dealing with telecommunications security risks currently threatening conventional networks.  The security of conventional public-key cryptography methods is based on the confidence that any attacker does not have enough computing power or mathematical knowledge to decrypt the message.  However, this method is becoming less secure as computing power increases and mathematical models become increasingly sophisticated.  Quantum-key distribution relies on quantum mechanics and provides a completely different way of creating cryptographic keys, providing much higher levels of security.  The researchers' metropolitan quantum-key distribution network can coexist with traditional communications networks, which they say is a major advantage as networks already have all the key components and have been successfully tested in experiments.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>Universidad Politecnica de Madrid</em><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fi.upm.es/?pagina=781&amp;idioma=english\">View Full Article </a></p>",

      "<p>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) engineers have successfully tested the first deep space communications network based on the Internet, using the Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol to transmit dozens of images to and from a spacecraft more than 20 million miles from Earth.  NASA and Google's Vint Cerf jointly developed the DTN protocol, which replaces the Internet's TCP/IP protocol for managing data transmissions.  &quot;This is the first step in creating a totally new space communications capability, an interplanetary Internet,&quot; says NASA's Adrian Hooke.  An interplanetary Internet needs to be strong enough to withstand delays, disruptions, and lost connections that space can cause.  For example, errors can happen when a spacecraft slips behind a planet, or when solar storms or long communication delays occur.  Even traveling at the speed of light, communications sent between Mars and Earth take between three-and-a-half minutes to 20 minutes.  Unlike TCP/IP, DTN does not assume there will be a constant end-to-end connection.  DTN is designed so that if a destination path cannot be found, the data packets are not discarded but are kept in a network node until it can safely communicate with another node.  In October, engineers started a month-long series of demonstrations, with data being transmitted using NASA's Deep Space Network twice a week.  Researchers say the interplanetary Internet could allow for new types of complex space missions that involve multiple landed, mobile, and orbiting spacecraft, as well as ensure reliable communications for astronauts on the surface of the moon.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</em><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-216\">View Full Article</a></p>",

      "<p>New statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor show that the IT profession may be stronger than the rest of the job market.  Although 240,000 jobs were lost nationwide in October, the IT profession actually grew during this period, with about 5,500 jobs being added to computer systems design and related services, and another 300 being added to management and technical consulting services.  Foote Partners CEO David Foote says the growth of the IT industry at a time when most other industries are shrinking demonstrates the health of the industry today.  In contrast, during the economic downturn earlier this decade, many IT jobs were cut.  The difference between then and now is that today large portions of the IT budget are tied to lines of business, and companies think about IT and how it relates to profit, instead of simply as an expense, Foote says.  He says many IT professionals are now knowledge workers and not just systems maintenance or programming workers.  Nevertheless, he cautions that highly paid IT senior and middle-management positions are still vulnerable because of their higher salaries.  Between January and July of this year, the U.S. high-tech industry added 78,300 jobs, a significant decrease from the 111,400 tech jobs added during the same period in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>Network World</em><br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/edu/2008/111708ed1.html\">View Full Article</a>",

The goal is to integrate brain-related senses such as perception and interaction into hardware and software to enable computers to process and understand data faster while consuming less power, says IBM researcher Dharmendra Modha.  Modha says neuroscience, nanotechnology, and supercomputing are all being combined as part of the effort to create a new computing platform.  &quot;If we could design computers that could be in real-world environments and sense and respond in an intelligent way, it would be a tremendous step forward,&quot; Modha says.  A typical computing process starts out by defining the objectives and then creates algorithms to achieve those objectives.  Modha says the brain works the opposite way, with a pre-established algorithm that is applied to problems as they arise, creating a platform that can address a wider variety of problems.  For example, the brain-based approach could help manage the world's water supplies using real-time analysis of data gathered by a network of sensors that monitor variables to discover new patterns.  Such an approach also could also be applied to world markets.

      "<p>IT security and cyberforensics are two areas with a critical need for more workers, writes Purdue University professor Eugene Spafford, chair of ACM's US Public Policy Committee.  Spafford says that computer science education has evolved from teaching the fundamentals for construction and systems in favor of a focus on all the places where computing can make a difference.  Before, computer science focused more on program solutions around individual host computers and only some distributed computation, but now the focus is on higher-level concepts in languages, graphics, and network computation.  Spafford says the security implications of this shift, and the shift in the industry toward cloud computing and large-scale networks, is largely unknown.  Information security is generally not in the regular IT curriculum, and a reasonable core curriculum for information security has not yet been determined.  Some schools, including Purdue, offer courses in secure programming as electives.  Many programming flaws are actually taught against in almost every curriculum, Spafford says, but problems arise because either students do not pay attention, are pressed for time, switch languages, or end up working in environments where productivity is stressed over quality.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>CSOonline.com</em><br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.csoonline.com/article/463063/Gene_Spafford_on_IT_Security_Education\">View Full Article</a>",

      "<p>Demand for Internet bandwidth will exceed the Internet's capacity by 2012, predicts a new Nemertes Research report.  Nemertes originally projected that Internet traffic would eclipse capacity by 2010, but the firm has since adjusted its prediction to reflect the economic crisis.  Nemertes does not expect the bandwidth crunch to cause the Internet to crash or shut down completely, but warns that users will experience brownouts that slow high-bandwidth applications such as high-definition video-streaming and peer-to-peer file sharing.  A major reason for the expected growth in traffic is the increasing popularity of virtual workers who work from home or remote offices.  These workers often require advanced communication and collaboration tools, such as Web and videoconferencing, according to the report.  Another major contributor is the large growth in high-bandwidth applications that users access.  Nemertes expects that an increasing number of Internet service providers will implement bandwidth caps that will enable them to charge extra for heavy bandwidth consumers.  The firm says that if the capacity issue is not addressed, the Internet will fracture into a tiered system in which companies with the most money will pay for specialized network infrastructure that ensures their content is delivered at a higher speed, while companies with less money will struggle to make their content accessible.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>Network World</em><br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/112108-internet-bandwidth-trouble.html\">View Full Article</a>",

      "<p>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign professor Marc Snir acknowledges that multicore parallelism is difficult, and this difficulty can give rise to divergent perspectives.  One perspective is that parallel programming is inherently difficult, while another posits that from an intrinsic point of view parallel programming is not substantially tougher than sequential programming, and is impeded by a shortfall of sufficient languages, tools, and architectures.  &quot;In this alternative view, different practices, supported by the right infrastructure, can make parallel programming prevalent,&quot; Snir reasons.  He notes that there are numerous classes of parallelism that are relatively simple to learn, which suggests that hard-to-comprehend code is the result of unstructured, unrestricted interaction between concurrent threads.  Although research in languages, tools, hardware, libraries, compilers, and other areas is necessary to make parallel programming easier, Snir says the ultimate solution &quot;will be one that brings together technologies from all these areas to bear on each other.&quot;  This cannot happen incrementally or reactively, and what is required is interdisciplinary research and the internalization of the co-design concept.

The scientists utilized the DOE's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Berkeley Lab, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facilities at Argonne National Laboratory, and the National Center of Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to test the Linearly Scaling Three Dimensional Fragment (LS3DF) technique.  LS3DF presents a more efficient method for calculating energy potential because it is based on the observation that the total energy of a large nanostructure system can be divided into small fragments, and each fragment can be calculated independently.  The LS3DF application attained a speed of 135 teraflops per second on NERSC's Cray XT4 system, 224 teraflops per second on Argonne's IBM BlueGene/P supercomputer, and 442 teraflops per second on a Cray XT5 system at the NCCS.  The electronic composition of a 3,500-atom ZnTeO alloy was computed by the algorithm using the NERSC supercomputer, and the run confirmed that the code could be employed to compute properties of the alloy that previously had been experimentally observed.  The model cleared the way for a projection of the alloy's efficiency as a new solar cell material, illustrating LS3DF's effectiveness as the first electronic structure code that runs efficiently on systems with tens to hundreds of thousands of cores.  &quot;Using a linear scaling algorithm, we can now study systems that would otherwise take over 1,000 times longer on even the biggest machines today,&quot; says Berkeley Lab researcher Juan Meza.  &quot;Instead of hours, we would be talking about months of computer time for a single study.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>From <em>Berkeley Lab</em><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2008/11/24/berkeley-lab-team-wins-special-acm-gordon-bell-prize-for-algorithm-innovation/\">View Full Article</a></p>",

      "<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory is working to create new economic models that will provide more realistic pictures of different types of markets to help prevent future economic crises.   Argonne systems scientist Charles Macal says traditional economic models do not represent the market's true internal dynamics because they ignore the decision-making processes of individual consumers and investors.  &quot;The traditional models don't represent individuals in the economy, or else they're all represented the same way--as completely rational agents,&quot; Macal says.  &quot;Because they ignore many other aspects of behavior that influence how people make decisions in real life, these models can't always accurately predict the dynamics of the market.&quot;  Macal and other Argonne researchers have created a new group of simulations called agent-based models to better predict how markets will act.  The new models partially rely on information collected in surveys that ask individuals about factors that influence their decisions.  By having a more thorough understanding of the behavior of individuals, researchers will be better able to predict and prevent economic failures.  Agent-based models calculate possible decisions for each individual investor in a model, using the results of these decisions to see what impact they could have on other agents.  Creating such detailed simulations relies on the availability of high-performance computers capable of managing the challenge of mathematically representing an enormous number of individual actors.

      "<p>University of Nottingham scientists are researching &quot;granular computing,&quot; a computer paradigm that examines groups or sets of information, called information granules, instead of looking at each piece of information individually.  Examining data in granules exposes new patterns and relationships, potentially leading to new types of computer modeling in a variety of fields.  Nottingham professor Andrzej Bargiela says the granular approach to computing is inspired by the human thought process.  &quot;Creating abstractions from detailed information is essential to human knowledge, interaction, and reasoning,&quot; Bargiela says.  &quot;The human brain filters the flood of information and distils knowledge subconsciously.&quot;  He says humans remember the message or purpose of information, not the specific details.  For example, people remember conversations, but not every specific word, which would be the raw data in a computer system.  Bargiela says a granular computing approach to information processing may lead to human-information processing technology, and could provide a breakthrough in dealing with information overload in a wide variety of applications.  Several Nottingham Ph.D. projects explore the application of granular computing, including projects on urban traffic monitoring and control, job scheduling, time-tabling, and protein classification.</p>\r\n<p>From <em>The University of Nottingham</em><br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://communications.nottingham.ac.uk/News/Article/A-human-approach-to-computer-processing.html\">View Full Article</a>",

In contrast to the Boomer generation, members of Generation Y prefer  more of a peer-infiltration approach.

      "<p>In this article, we study the problem of distributed selection from a theoretical point of view. Given a general connected graph of diameter <i>D</i> consisting of <i>n</i> nodes in which each node holds a numeric element, the goal of a <i>k</i>-selection algorithm is to determine the <i>k</i><sup><i>th</i></sup> smallest of these elements. We prove that distributed selection indeed requires more work than other aggregation functions such as, e.g., the computation of the average or the maximum of all elements. On the other hand, we show that the <i>k</i><sup><i>th</i></sup> smallest element can be computed efficiently by providing both a randomized and a deterministic <i>k</i>-selection algorithm, dispelling the misconception that solving distributed selection through in-network aggregation is infeasible.</p>",
