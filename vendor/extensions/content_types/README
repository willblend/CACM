= ContentTypes

Created by Sean Cribbs, September 2007

ContentTypes provide internal structure to Radiant pages to create an extra layer of
flexibility in Layout development.  This is accomplished by:

 * Specifying the Layout that will be used by pages with a given content_type
 * Specifying the parts (and their filters) that will be editable in the 
   page interface
 * Adding a popup menu to the site map in which a content_type for a new
   page can be chosen
