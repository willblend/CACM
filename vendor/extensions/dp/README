DigitalPulp Radiant Core Extensions
***********************************

NOTES
* Please keep every file in the lib directory to a sole dependency unless absolutely necessary
* Two methods having two separate dependencies should use two separate files even if their behaviors are being injected into the same class
* The goal is to allow you to proceed with a normal radiant install as described in the radiant docs without errors or warnings that aren't caught and explained

EXTENSIONS
* Should call out the plugins they need on activate
* No plugins should live in the individual extensions
* Place the plugins in vendor/plugins
* Plugins may live in this extension that are truly required for every project (?)

TODOs
* Add WillPaginateForRadiant
* Extract Search from VNSNY, Update to the latest TS & Update the SphinxSearchExtension
