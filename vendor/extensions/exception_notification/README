= EXCEPTION NOTIFICATION

Extends Radiant's error handling to include email notification and Radiant-
managed error templates for exceptions raised in other extensions. Based on 
Jamis Buck's original Rails exception notifier.

= USAGE

 1. Enable ActionMailer

    Locate +config.frameworks -= [ :action_mailer ]+ in config/environment.rb.
    Comment out this line, or remove action_mailer from the list of frameworks
    you are skipping.
    
 2. Define the email addresses ExceptionNotifier should use
 
    Set the following somewhere within your environment:
    
    ExceptionNotifier.email_to   = 'send@to.email'
    ExceptionNotifier.email_from = 'sent@from.email'
    
 3. Create some error templates

    Exception Notification adds an additional Page subclass called 
    InternalServerErrorPage. This and its existing sibling, FileNotFoundPage,
    determine what gets rendered when an exception is raised. Create one of
    each within your content tree. ExceptionNotification is aware of the
    multi-site extension, so you can create individual error pages for
    each site.
    
= NOTES

By default, your FileNotFound page will be rendered when the following 
exceptions are caught: 

  * ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  * ActionController::UnknownController
  * ActionController::UnknownAction
  * ActionController::RoutingError
  
All other errors will render with an InternalServerErrorPage. Both templates 
are rendered even when running in development mode. If you'd like your stack 
traces displayed (like dev mode in a standard Rails application,) set the
following somewhere within your environment:
  
  Radiant::Config['debug?'] = true
