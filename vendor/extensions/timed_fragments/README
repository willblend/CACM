= Timed Fragments

This is the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work and it probably won't 
if you're using Rails > 2.0.2. Fragment lifetime is global across all fragments 
and can be adjusted in timed_fragments_extension.rb.

Add this to whatever environments you desire:
Page.perform_caching = true

You should read Rails' Fragment Caching docs, in ActionController::Caching::Fragments.
